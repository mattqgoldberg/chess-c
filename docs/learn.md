# What have I learned making this project?

## Cmake

 - Setting up cmake is simple and makes life much easier with globbing files together to be compiled and settings compiler flags etc.



## Random notes
 - C89 standard does not allow initializing int i inside of the for loop? I switched to C99 standard solely for this reason.
 - Manually creating tests for this is very tedious and error prone. Future plans would be much better to have some test set I can import or generate not by hand.
 - Actual game logic is relatively simple to implement so far, I think check and checkmate might be the most complicated but we will see.
